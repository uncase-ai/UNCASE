## The Startup Metrics Hierarchy

Not all metrics are created equal. Focus on these tiers:

### Tier 1: Validation Metrics

These tell you if anyone cares about what you're building.

### Tier 2: Engagement Metrics

These reveal how users interact with your product.

### Tier 3: Growth Metrics

These show whether you're building something scalable.

## Essential Early-Stage Metrics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

How much does it cost to acquire a customer? This metric is crucial for understanding the sustainability of your growth.

```
CAC = Total Marketing & Sales Spend / Number of New Customers
```

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

How much revenue will a customer generate over their lifetime?

```
LTV = Average Revenue Per User × Customer Lifetime
```

The golden rule: **LTV should be at least 3x your CAC**.

### Activation Rate

What percentage of signups become active users? This metric reveals whether your onboarding experience works.

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

For SaaS startups, MRR is the heartbeat of your business. Track:

- New MRR
- Expansion MRR
- Churned MRR
- Net MRR growth

### Churn Rate

How many customers are you losing? Early-stage startups should aim for monthly churn below 5%.

## The North Star Metric

Beyond individual metrics, identify your North Star-the single metric that best captures the core value you deliver. For example:

- **Airbnb**: Nights booked
- **Spotify**: Time spent listening
- **Slack**: Messages sent

## Tracking Traction

Use these milestones to gauge progress:

1. **First 10 paying customers**: Validates willingness to pay
2. **Positive unit economics**: Shows scalability potential
3. **Consistent MoM growth**: Indicates product-market fit

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**Don't:**

- Track too many metrics
- Focus on vanity metrics
- Ignore qualitative feedback
- Optimize for the wrong goal

**Do:**

- Keep your dashboard simple
- Review metrics weekly
- Talk to churned users
- Iterate based on data

## Setting Up Your Analytics Stack

Start simple:

1. **Google Analytics**: For web traffic
2. **Mixpanel or Amplitude**: For product analytics
3. **Stripe or Chargebee**: For revenue metrics
4. **Customer interviews**: For qualitative insights

## From Metrics to Action

Data without action is just noise. Establish a rhythm:

- **Daily**: Monitor critical metrics
- **Weekly**: Deep-dive into changes
- **Monthly**: Review trends and set goals
- **Quarterly**: Adjust strategy

## Conclusion

The right metrics provide a roadmap for your startup journey. They help you make smarter decisions, iterate faster, and track progress toward product-market fit. Start tracking these metrics from day one, and launch with confidence.
