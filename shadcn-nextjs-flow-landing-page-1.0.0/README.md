## Overview 🌏

**This isn&apos;t a traditional component library or a replacement for Shadcn**. Instead, it&apos;s a unique collection offers customizable variants of components, blocks, and templates. Preview, customize, and copy-paste them into your apps with ease.

Building on the solid foundation of the Shadcn components & blocks, we&apos;ve enhanced it with custom-designed components & blocks to give you a head start. This allows you to craft, customize, and ship your projects faster and more efficiently.

### Not a standard library, but a distribution of components

Following the philosophy of Shadcn, shadcn/studio isn&apos;t a conventional &quot;install-from-NPM&quot; library. Rather, it&apos;s an open-source distribution of components designed for maximum adaptability. You can copy the code, modify styles, adjust logic, or integrate it with other tools-free from the limitations of typical libraries. This &quot;open code&quot; model empowers you to customize with confidence and creativity.

## Why should I use shadcn/studio? 💡

shadcn/ui aims to provide core components with a unique distribution system, allowing developers to copy and paste reusable, customizable UI elements directly into their codebase.

While this approach offers flexibility and control, it comes with some limitations: a lack of diverse component variants examples, limited theme customization options, and limited pre-built blocks. Additionally, its extensive customization options, though powerful, can sometimes feel overwhelming, especially for those seeking a more guided or streamlined experience.
